# User Personas in UX/UI Design

## Overview

User personas are semi-fictional characters based on real data, representing different user types that might use a product or service. They are essential tools in UX/UI design, helping to understand users' needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals. By focusing on these personas, designers and developers can create products that resonate with their target audience.

## Purpose of User Personas

In the context of UX/UI design, user personas help teams to:

- **Identify the needs of different user segments:** This ensures that the design process considers a diverse range of users.
- **Align the team around a common understanding:** Personas help to keep the focus on user-centric design throughout the development process.
- **Guide decisions during the design process:** From feature prioritization to interface design, user personas ensure that decisions are grounded in real user data.

## When to Use User Personas

User personas are typically created during the **Define** stage of the design process. This stage is part of the Double Diamond model, a framework that guides designers through four phases: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver. During the Define stage, designers synthesize research findings into user personas, which then inform the ideation and prototyping phases.

## Example Personas

Below are examples of user personas that I have created for past projects. These personas illustrate how user data can be translated into actionable insights to guide design decisions.
